My solutions to coding problems from Gayle McDowell's CTCI.

## Python

It's recommend you use a venv, to prevent running into issues with black.

Inside the Python folder, run:

`python -m venv env`

And then activate the virtual environment. I've included a PowerShell script for Windows users.

A Makefile provides a wrapper for some common commands you may want to run, such as `make format` and `make run`.

## C++
